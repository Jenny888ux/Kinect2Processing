# Kinect2Processing

Sketches for **Processing 3** with **Kinect v2**. They require the [KinectPV2](http://codigogenerativo.com/kinectpv2/) library by Thomas Lengeling.

I developed these sketches for my course [Interaction Engineering](http://interaction.hs-augsburg.de) at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences, as explained in my [Kinect chapter](http://michaelkipp.de/interaction/kinect.html) (German) of my course notes.
